Known issues:
1. Generating cuts for RQUAD, fixed.
2. Producing cola.pc file
3. Conic mps reader of Cola (uses Coinutils for this) fails on some mosek mps
files. in BOUNDS section mosek may use redundant fields. One example is

BOUNDS:
 LI bound     x2        0
 MI bound     x2

This piece of mps file is OK for Mosek but not for Coinuitls mps file reader.
First line means variable x2 is integer and has 0 lower bound. Second line
means variable x2 is integer and has no bound. Mosek applies these two bounds
together. Which means second line is redundant. Mosek can behave in this manner
due to the hole in the specification of MPS standard.

Coinutils excepts only one line specification for each variable (MPS language
is expressive enough to acheive this). The example above can be fixed by
removing the redundant second line. Then Coinutils will have no problem to read
it. The following means same to both mosek and Coinutils and readible by both of
them.

BOUNDS:
 LI bound     x2        0
