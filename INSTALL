Basic Installation Instructions
===============================================================================
Run the following command in COLA directory.

./get_dependencies.sh && compile.sh

get_dependencies.sh will download Osi, CoinUtils, OsiConic and Clp. compile.sh
will compile dependencies and Cola and it will install dependency libraries and
Cola library to COLA/build/lib. Header files will be installed to
COLA/build/include/coin. Pkg-config .pc files will be installed to
COLA/build/lib/pkgconfig.

Then you can run cola on mps files using the following command.

./build/bin/cola ex.mps

Advanced Installation Instructions
===============================================================================
Dependencies:
You should make sure that the following libraries can be accessed through pkg-config;
osi-clp, osi, coinutils.

First you must use autotools to create configure script. You can do this by
running 'autoreconf --install'

Then, configure, make and 'make install' steps should work. We install to the current
directory by default. You can install to specific directories using --prefix
option of configure.

Create configure script:
autoreconf --install

Install to ./build:
installs binary to ./build/bin library to ./build/lib and header files to
./build/include

mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
make install

Install to some-path:
../configure --prefix='some-path'
make
make install

You can go to test and run solve.sh to run cola on problems in Data/random/
directory. You may need to edit solve.sh depending on where you installed cola.
