Installation Instructions
*************************

Dependencies:
You should make sure that the following libraries can be accessed through pkg-config;
osi-clp, osi, coinutils.

First you must use autotools to create configure script. You can do this by
running 'autoreconf --install' in ./trunk

Then, configure, make and 'make install' steps should work. We install to the current
directory by default. You can install to specific directories using --prefix
option of configure.

Example:
cd trunk
autoreconf --install
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
make install

installs binary to ./build/bin library to ./build/lib and header files to
./build/include

You can go to test and run solve.sh to run cola on problems in Data/random/
directory.
